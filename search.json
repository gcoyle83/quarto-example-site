Recognizing that we all face similar issues in selecting and learning about various “pieces” of the Python development process, we elected to work together toward pooling our collective experience through regular (monthly) discussion of best practices and generation of documentation around what works (or notably doesn’t work) well for Python projects.\n\nDevelopment Group Members\nThe Python Dev Group members are voluntary and unofficial. If you are interested in joining the group to participate in these discussions, please reach out to a current team member and let them know.\n\nGreg Coyle"

This section of the site offers guidance on which tools to use to get started and is based purely on our present abilities to provide guidance rather than any claims of one tool being better than any other. The tools identified and summarized here are selected based on current usage and willingness of a team member to share their knowledge here.

    "text": "Integrated Development Environments\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs) are the workhorse for efficient software development, whether doing simple scripting or developing complex machine learning systems. The recommended IDE for Python development at present is VS Code, in the sense that current contributors to this content use VS Code and have more knowledge to share about VS Code than other IDEs such as, for example, PyCharm or Spyder.\n\nVS Code\nVisual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free multi-language IDE developed by Microsoft and is popularly used by software engineers for developing solutions in numerous languages. The VS Code extensions ecosystem is large and active - there are extensions for linting, formatting, source control, containerization, cloud computing services and much (much) more.\nReady to give it a try? See our primer on installing and setting up VS Code to effectively collaborate on Python development projects.\n\n\nOthers\nFeel free to add short descriptions of your favorite IDE and link to a primer page here."
