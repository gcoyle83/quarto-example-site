Recognizing that we all face similar issues in selecting and learning about various “pieces” of the Python development process, we elected to work together toward pooling our collective experience through regular (monthly) discussion of best practices and generation of documentation around what works (or notably doesn’t work) well for Python projects.\n\nDevelopment Group Members\nThe Python Dev Group members are voluntary and unofficial. If you are interested in joining the group to participate in these discussions, please reach out to a current team member and let them know."

This section of the site offers guidance on which tools to use to get started and is based purely on know-how rather than any claims of one tool being better than any other. The tools identified and summarized here are selected based on current usage and willingness of a team member to share their knowledge here. If you like a tool that is not included in this section, please contribute content to improve the coverage here.\n\n\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs) are the workhorse for efficient software development, whether doing simple scripting or developing complex machine learning systems. The recommended IDE for Python development at present is VS Code, in the sense that current contributors to this content use VS Code and have more knowledge to share about VS Code than other IDEs such as, for example, PyCharm or Spyder.\n\n\nVisual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free multi-language IDE developed by Microsoft and is popularly used by software engineers for developing solutions in numerous languages. The VS Code extensions ecosystem is large and active - there are extensions for linting, formatting, source control, containerization, cloud computing services and much (much) more.\nReady to give it a try? See our primer on installing and setting up VS Code to effectively collaborate on Python development projects.\n\n\n\nFeel free to add short descriptions of your favorite IDE and link to a primer page here.\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps more controversial than what IDE to use, what tools should you use to manage project packages and evironments?\n\n\nThe much maligned but rarely defeated…\n\n\n\nThe foundation…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage and environment management is necessary but insufficient to ensure reproducible projects.

Similar sites for R, Julia and other useful languages will probably be helpful, but are beyond the present scope of this site. The primary objectives for development of this site were outlined at the September 2023 “hackathon” in Andover, MA, including:\n\nInstallation and setup instructions for basic development tools (Anaconda, VS Code, et cetera)\nRecommendations for standard scaffolding of Python project repositories in GitHub, including best practices for coding standards, formatting, unit testing and project documentation\nLinks to/recommendations for “learning paths” to help young professionals develop software/coding skills\n\nTo learn more about the collaborators on the effort, see the About page.\n\nWebsite developed using Quarto.
