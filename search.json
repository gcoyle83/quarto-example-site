Similar sites for R, Julia and other useful languages will probably be helpful, but are beyond the present scope of this site. The primary objectives for development of this site were outlined at the September 2023 “hackathon” in Andover, MA, including:\n\nInstallation and setup instructions for basic development tools (Anaconda, VS Code, et cetera)\nRecommendations for standard scaffolding of Python project repositories in GitHub, including best practices for coding standards, formatting, unit testing and project documentation\nLinks to/recommendations for “learning paths” to help young professionals develop software/coding skills\n\nTo learn more about the collaborators on the effort, see the About page.\n\nWebsite developed using Quarto.
